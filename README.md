**Tagline:** Fast-track freelancer verification with AI-powered document analysis

## About
**GigIT** is a backend API designed to help banks verify freelancers quickly using their tax forms (e.g., 1099). Users submit their documents, and our API analyzes them using **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to produce a verification report. Underwriters then review the report, significantly reducing the time it takes for freelancers to get approved.
